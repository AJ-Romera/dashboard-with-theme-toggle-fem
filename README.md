## Overview

### The challenge

This is a challenge from [FrontendMentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/social-media-dashboard-with-theme-switcher-6oY8ozp_H). (This is the web if you want to take the challenge or other frontend good challenges)

It consists on building out a social media dashboard with a theme toggle and get it looking as close to the design as possible, using any tool I like. It has to be responsive (at least mobile and desktop)
